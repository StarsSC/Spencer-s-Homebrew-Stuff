		<description>Iskuur is a god of seas and storms and chaos, a sinker of ships. A god whose emblem is a shattered sea wall, a symbol of landbound authority sundered by his might. A god of sunken ships and broken chains, and freedom defended by might. He strongly opposes slavery, tyranny, and the restriction of free will, but also organised navies, sea defenses, and the rule of law. He has a mixed approach to fisherpeople, favouring spear fishers but violently disliking net/trap fishers, and many fishing ships pray to other sea gods for protection from him. Iskuur is a god who emphasises survival, endurance and freedom above all, and while he powerfully opposes physical constraints on a person’s will, such as captivity, that is nothing to how he opposes psychological or magical assaults on will. If you would impose your authority on another’s will in the presence of Iskuur or any of his devout, you may expect the storm, the lightning, or the wave.</description>

		<description>The thing called Ket is the first and formless evil of the world. It is the first spark of malice, the first selfish thought, the first swell of violence. It is the whispering at the back of every mind, the nudge to embrace your urges, indulge your whims, feed your hungers. Ket has neither face nor form. It holds itself part of everything, the potential for corruption lurking in even the purest of souls. There are many that doubt Ket even exists, viewing those who claim to worship it as simply seeking an excuse for their own failings. But even gods have heard Ket’s whisperings, and trembled at the thought that they are naught but their own failings murmuring back at them. Thus even the purest might cling to the worship or at least acknowledgement of Ket, for if Ket is not a deity, if Ket does not exist, then where can these whispers come from? If evil has no external source, who is our enemy but ourselves?</description>

		<description>Nuissas is the Mother Night, the primal darkness, the black void that cradled creation. Before there was anything, there was Nuissas, and after all light fades, there will be Nuissas still. She is Eyeless, for when she came into being there was not yet light. Yet creation, the seeding of light in her darkness, the eruption of life and light and magic, was not an affront to the Mother Night. Light and life are angry, energetic things, that must spend themselves until they fade. The darkness is eternal, ever-patient, and so is Nuissas. She coils herself around them, above and beneath and through them, and bears them gently up until they are spent. The Mother Night is the goddess of night, of primal darkness, of void, of shadow, of the blackness of those depths where light has never reached. She is the sacred darkness that shelters and shields, and the patient abyss to which all light returns. Her worshippers are those who dwell in darkness and those who revere the night, who ask for her protection and patience and the shelter of her shadow, for she is pleased to grant it. When she appears to them, her form is always eyeless, and rarely humanoid. Most commonly, it is said that she takes the shape of a vast abyssal fish, or a black, eyeless dragon, coiling around and beneath the world, through the depths where darkness lies deepest and most sacred.</description>

		<description>Immara is the dreaming goddess of the deep, the goddess of moon and tide, of dreams and prophecy, of shipwrecks and forgotten mysteries. She is the goddess of mist and storm, of flotsam and jetsam, of messages in bottles. She is the dreaming ocean, the tides of history moving across a fathomless, forgotten deep. She is the siren call of the sea, stirring souls to seek hidden things. Immara is not a goddess favoured of sailors and fishermen, her call too strange and entrancing. Instead, she is the goddess of omens and tides, of seekers and prophets, dreamers and explorers. Those who dive ocean wrecks, seek sunken cities, or dream strange dreams in the ocean mist. Her worship is scattered, and individual, her prophets and her priests coming to her often through their dreams, but many who hope for good omens or fortune on the waves might still give an offering of rice wine or moonstones in her name, spilled or thrown into the sea at moonrise. </description>

		<description>The Holy Fire, the Light of Truth, the All-Seeing. One of the first and oldest gods, Oromasdes is the god of the sun, of light, of magic, of truth, and of judgement. His is the all-seeing eye, the font of knowledge, the burning fire of inspiration. He favours the magics of divination and truth-seeking, and the cleansing fires of judgement and renewal. Those who seek knowledge, truth, or the wisdom to make good judgements pray to him. He is the god of diviners, watchmen, researchers and intelligence agents, and also the god of judges, sages and scholars. Oromasdes is not opposed to lies or trickery in the pursuit of noble goals, but self-delusion and the destruction or denial of knowledge are the greatest of faults in his eyes.</description>
