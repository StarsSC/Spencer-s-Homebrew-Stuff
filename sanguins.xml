			<p class="flavor">Born out of a sinister rite that blended celestial and ancient vampire energy with sorcerous magic, sanguins were designed to fit in with human society while carrying out the vampire creators' wishes. Many sanguins eventually broke away from their sinister beginnings in an effort to find a method to reconcile their vampire and human halves.</p>
			<h4>Twilight Born</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Sanguins, descendants of ancient bloodlines, possess a primarily human appearance that allows them to blend seamlessly into society. However, their eerie heritage manifests in subtle but distinct traits, such as unnaturally bright eyes that often shimmer in low light and sharp, slightly pointed teeth that evoke suspicions of vampiric ancestry. These physical markers, though rare and often overlooked, can occasionally stir fear or fascination in those who notice them. Despite these hints of their supernatural lineage, sanguins are adept at navigating human communities, using their resemblance to humanity to form lasting relationships and lead lives of duality. Some sanguins choose to embrace their hidden heritage, wielding the powers passed down from their ancestors in secret, while others suppress these gifts in an effort to assimilate completely. Their ability to move between worlds—one mundane, the other shadowed by their mysterious origins—makes them versatile and complex beings, often torn between the need for belonging and the call of something darker.</p>
