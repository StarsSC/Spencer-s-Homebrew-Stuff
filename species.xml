		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Animated suits of armor, or simply 'anarmors', are created to serve a specific purpose under their creator. When their creator dies, they are often left to lie dormant, waiting for the right moment to spring back into action. They find their place in vaults, towers, gardens, dungeons, mansions, castles; anywhere a sentry or guard might be. When animated armors are left alone for long enough, their magical programming comes undone. Oftentimes, upon awakening, these constructs attain a new level of sentience and seek out a new purpose. Some animated armors are inhabited by the souls of other sentient races, making them a living weapon.</p>
			<h4>Living Weapons</h4>
			<p>Animated armors are full sets of armor that can move and speak on their own, their various pieces of plating seemingly unburdened by gravity. While they have no physical presence inside them, they function like a person in a full suit of armor. They can be molded or cast to fit many races, and can be anything from small enough to comfortably fit a gnome to large enough to completely cover a half-orc. Their weight and size, as well as their design and material, are up to their creator. While metal is most often used, anarmors utilizing elements of leather, stone, or animal skins are not unheard of. Magic is used to bring the armor to life, either by using a spell to program it or by placing the soul of a living or formerly living being inside of it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Though they may not have any sensory organs whatsoever, magic ensures that anarmors can perceive what is around them. They can see, hear, and feel things, though not always to the extent that other races can, even if they were once a living being. They can also communicate by means of magic. Magic guides their artificial consciousnesses, translating their thoughts into sounds that can be perceived by other creatures. Their armor acts as their skin, and any damage inflicted upon their plating is felt as damage to what would be their physical form if they were a living being. Should they sustain enough damage, the spell holding their parts together will dissipate, leaving them to fall apart completely.</p>
			<p class="indent">Magical means, in any form they take, can be used to bring anarmors back together, even if it is only one piece at a time. At low health, animated armors often find that whole limbs will disconnect from their bodies, but certain spells can undo the damage and mend their armored exteriors as if they were composed of flesh. The gaps between their plating have no physical presence; if a certain anarmor is designed with a horizontal gap separating its torso from its waist, slashing through it without touching the plating will cause no damage whatsoever. Only striking the material the armor is composed of will cause physical harm to an animated armor.</p>
            <p class="indent">To hide the fact that they are living suits of armor as opposed to warriors simply wearing suits of armor, anarmors will use cloaks, scarves, or bandages to cover the gaps between their plating. Some anarmors have arcane lights that are fixed in the space inside their helmets. These projections are meant to resemble eyes, and shift and move according to what expression the anarmor might be making. Though they serve no function other than making it look like they have eyes, these lights are often enough to keep the average person from getting too suspicious.</p>
            <h4>Dormancy</h4>
			<p>Normal suits of armor usually last as long as their material does, the elements hazing them until they eventually rust over and crumble to pieces. Animated armors are not usually this fragile, however. If magic is used to bring a suit of armor to life, another spell is usually cast on the armor to make it more durable. The stronger the spell, the longer the armor lasts. A typical anarmor can lie dormant for 250 years before losing its magic. The maximum lifespan of an animated armor is unknown, as a powerful enough spell could potentially keep one alive forever, but none have been known to keep their magic for more than 500 years.</p>
			<p class="indent">Unlike other creatures blessed with long life, anarmors don't actively pursue goals outside of what they were created to do; if a particular animated armor was created to protect a castle, it will stay in the castle, silently waiting for an intruder. That said, they can leave their posts or occupations if they wish, but most are not given a good enough reason to, remaining dormant until someone finds them. Unless they are doing their job constantly, they will become as still as a statue, waking only when a certain stimulus triggers a response.</p>
            <p class="indent">When they do awake, animated armors often find that they are in a world far different than the one they know. To them, time has passed by without them, leaving them lost in a strange and mysterious future. A time gap as small as fifty years can be enough to confuse an anarmor, but if they are intelligent enough, they will catch on to present-time customs fairly quickly, Still, some refuse to change their ways, speaking in forgotten tongues or using overly-wordy and poetic speech. Others do not speak at all.</p>
			<h4>Reawakening and Rebirth</h4>
			<p>Anarmors usually fall dormant at the post given to them by their creator, waiting for something to bring them back into consciousness. If their creator happens to die before or after they enter this state, their purpose will no longer be explicitly defined. When they regain consciousness, most anarmors stick to their prior orders, carrying out their tasks without complaint. But some, rather than do a task that is now impossible, pointless, or both, defy their creator's magical programming and seek out a new purpose. To some degree, this allows anarmors to develop personalities and become sentient. Glitches in the magical programming that make up an anarmor’s mind can also cause a personality to form. Anarmors that possess the soul of a formerly living being almost always realize who they once were, but some are forced to rediscover themselves or discover a new identity altogether.</p>
			<p class="indent">Others forget their initial purpose entirely, wandering around aimlessly until someone decides to claim them. Many times, an adventurer will stumble upon a long-forgotten animated armor and convince it to join them on their travels. Others are reactivated only to find that the thing they were meant to protect has been destroyed somehow, and seek vengeance. In this way, anarmors can be anything from loyal companions and protectors to destructive avengers and mercenaries.</p>
			<h4>Ghosts in Armor</h4>
			<p>Generally, people see animated armors as threats. The thought of a walking, talking suit of armor terrifies them, similar to how most races view tieflings. It doesn’t help that many adventurers are used to fighting animated armors, sentient or not. They are often likened to ghosts in armor, and many villages have their own tales of menacing suits of armor that move of their own volition.</p>
            <p class="indent">Because of this, anarmors that wander into unsuspecting towns are usually avoided completely, the only words spoken of them being whispers. Those who know better than this see wandering anarmors as potential companions, workers, or servants. Some are even ambitious or crazy enough to try and capture them by force, but this rarely works. Taverns and brothels usually look the other way, since being intangible except for one's armor doesn't lend itself to enjoying such frivolities.</p>
            <p class="indent">That said, an anarmor will usually try to avoid being discovered, unless a quirk in their personality programming says otherwise. They'll use cloaks, scarves, and bandages to cover the gaps in their armor and blend in. They'll stay away from crowded places, speaking only when spoken to and never causing too much of a scene.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some spend their time in taverns, never ordering any food or drink, hoping that the patrons will be too drunk to notice how empty they are on the inside. On the rare occasion that an animated armor is welcomed or even worshipped by the people of a village, an anarmor might serve the community as a guard or sentry. Others may take a more commanding role, like a war chief or even a deity.</p>
            <p class="indent">When it comes to other races, animated armors are interesting in that they can have an affinity with any race or none at all. It very much depends on the whether or not the anarmor identifies with the race the armor was originally made for.</p>
			<h4>ANIMATED ARMOR NAMES</h4>
			<p class="indent">An animated armor's name is usually bestowed by its creator. Sometimes, however, they forget their names. When this happens, a name can be given to them by a new owner or partner, or they can come up with a name themselves. When an anarmor comes up with a name for itself, it's usually something simple, something they see around them or remember from their past. Really, any name will do, whether it's based on their function, their appearance, or their surroundings. Some are based in the creator's native tongue, whatever that may be.</p>

			<h4>ANIMATED ARMOR TRAITS</h4>
			<p>A suit of armor that is given life through magic and is assigned a task. Often they are left behind by their creators, left to lie dormant for hundreds of years only to wake up and seek out a new purpose.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Since animated armors are essentially timeless, age is only a factor in terms of appearance, not maturity. This does not make an anarmor completely immune to the effects of aging, however. When considering an anarmor’s age, consider the physical age of the armor, the age of the consciousness taking control of the armor, whether the consciousness was created or implanted, and how long the armor and the consciousness have been bonded. A normal suit of armor may grow old, rust, and eventually disintegrate over several decades. However, due to their magical nature, anarmors can survive in the same suit of armor for several centuries without experiencing such effects. The maximum lifespan of an animated armor is unknown, but none have been known to keep their magic for more than 500 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Animated armors generally hold to the will of their creator. Because of this, anarmors are typically of a lawful alignment.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Though armors vary in size and shape, an animated armor's height is based on the race it was designed to be worn by while its weight corresponds the armor on which its subrace is based. Regardless of the size of the race your armor was designed for, or the size of the armor you use your Soul Transfer trait to move into, your size is always Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed depends on your subrace, as shown below.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Antimagic Susceptibility.</em></strong> You have disadvantage in skill checks and attack rolls while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Blindsight.</em></strong> You can perceive your surroundings without relying on sight within a specific radius. You have a blindsight range of 60 feet, but are blind beyond this radius.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Construct.</em></strong> You are a suit of armor made of a variety of durable materials. Your creature type is construct instead of humanoid. As such, spells like cure wounds don't affect you, and you are immune to spells like crown of madness or dominate person because they specifically target humanoids. You are immune to poison damage, being poisoned, and diseases. You do not need to eat or breathe, and any food you do attempt to eat falls through the space where your head would be and into the bottom of your armor. Rather than sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 6 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>False Appearance.</em></strong> While you remain motionless, you are indistinguishable from a normal suit of armor.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mendable.</em></strong>When the mending spell is cast on you, it has the following alterations: It has a casting time of 1 action. If you have 0 hit points you become stable. As part of the casting of mending the caster may expend any level of spell slot to cause you to regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8, plus their spellcasting ability modifier. For each level of the spell slot expended you regain an additional 1d8 hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Soul Transfer.</em></strong>You can transfer your consciousness into another suit of armor over the course of a short or long rest. During that time you or another creature performs an hour-long ritual. Over the course of that hour, you must remain within 5 feet of the armor, or the ritual fails. This change may alter your subrace accordingly, based on the desired armor's type. If you are not proficient in the armor you transfer yourself into, you will receive all the detriments that someone normally would by wearing a set of armor they are not proficient with, as well as a -2 penalty to your Armor Class.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read and write Common, as well as the language of your creator. Given that animated armors are often created by powerful spellcasters, the exotic languages of magic such as Draconic or Primordial are commonly known by them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> The armor your soul inhabits determines certain traits about you. The classifications are Light, Medium and Heavy.</p>

			<description>The armor your soul inhabits is chain mail, making your Armor Class 16. If you use your Soul Transfer trait to transfer yourself to another piece of heavy armor then the formula for calculating your Armor Class becomes that of the armor you transfer yourself to. You are also affected by any other additional properties of the armor such as a Strength requirement, a disadvantage on Stealth checks, a bonus to your Armor Class or even a curse.</description>

	<element name="Broxclaw" type="Race" source="Spencer's Homebrew" id="ID_RACE_BROXCLAW">
		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The Broxclaw are a strong and resilient race of humanoid badgers that reside south of the Embercrest Mountains in Eldrimor, known for their physical power, druidic magic, and deep connection to nature. These black-and-white-striped beings stand tall on two legs, radiating both strength and wisdom. With their sturdy build and nomadic lifestyle, the Broxclaw are a formidable presence, both in battle and in the wild.</p>
			<h4>Nomads of the Wild</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>The Broxclaw live a nomadic life, avoiding big cities in favor of the untamed wilderness. They travel from place to place, often in small, close-knit groups, setting up temporary camps in secluded forests or rugged hills. They choose this lifestyle to stay connected to nature, which they see as the source of their strength and magic. Rarely do they settle in one spot for long, preferring the freedom of the open road and the ever-changing landscape.</p>
            <h4>Druidic Battle Magic</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Broxclaw society is deeply rooted in druidic magic. They have a natural talent for harnessing the primal forces of nature, which they use to great effect in battle. By combining their raw physical strength with nature's magic, Broxclaw warriors are a powerful force. Their magic often enhances their physical abilities, protects them with natural elements, or unleashes the fury of the wild on their enemies. This unique blend of druidic power and brute strength makes them versatile and unpredicatable fighters.</p>
			<h4>Strength and Resilience</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Physically, the Broxclaw are large for medium-sized creatures, usually standing a bit over 7 feet tall with broad shoulders and muscular bodies. Their fur is often striped in black and white, much like the badgers they resemble. The Broxclaw's physical strength is matched by their mental toughness; they are known for their stubbornness and determination, traits that help them survive in the wild.</p>
			<h4>BROXCLAW NAMES</h4>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The Dremora are creatures of great strength and steadfast loyalty that live in the darkest recesses of the Abyss, which are home to the most evil beings. Standing between six and eight feet tall, these humanoids had skin as dark as the abyss itself, with hints of grey and scarlet.</p>
			<h4>Selfish and Ambitious</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Dremora are infamous for their complete lack of mercy, ambition, and haughtiness. They make deals with evil or chaotic neutral lesser deities, pledging conquest, increased rank, or any other favor deemed deserving in exchange for their fighting skills and dedication.</p>
      <h4>A Strict Hierarchy</h4>
      <br/>
      <p>Organized into clan-like structure, Dremora are categorized into distinct ranks, each holding varying degrees of power and prestige. From the lowly Churl to the esteemed Valkynaz, they navigate a hierarchical society fueled by rivalry and ambition. While it's common for groups or entire clans to forge pacts with deities, there are instances where individual Dremora pursue their own agendas, driven by personal ambition or a thirst for power.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="feature">Names:</span>Voragorath, Drakulorin, Zalthorak, Morgrath, Nexilvar.</p>
			<h4>SANGUIN TRAITS</h4>
			<br/>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and Constitution increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Dremora mature at the same rate as humans, but live about twice as long on the material plane. On the plane of the Abyss, they can live practically forever, unless slain.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Dremora are typically evil, driven by pride, ambition, and mercilessness. Without pacts, they may very rarely lean towards neutrality, and when bound by agreements with lesser deities, they often become lawful.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Dremora typically stand between 6 to 8 feet tall. Your size is medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Infernal Boon.</em></strong> You know the Firebolt cantrip, Strength is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Abyssal Veil.</em></strong> You cannot be detected by spells or abilities that detect the presence of fiendish creatures, such as Divine Sense or Detect Evil and Good.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Gifts from Oblivion.</em></strong> Upon reaching 3rd level, after your first long rest, you are granted a weapon known as the "Sword of Inferno". This weapon can be either a Longsword or Greatsword, determined by your choice. The Sword of Inferno is considered magical and deals an additional 1d4 fire damage on hit.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dark Condemnation.</em></strong> If you die, your death is permanent and you cannot be resurrected by any means. Any attempt to cast resurrection spells or similar magic on you instantly transports your soul to the plane of the Abyss instead, where you shall remain for eternity.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Abyssal.</p>

	<element name="Dusktail" type="Race" source="Spencer's Homebrew" id="ID_RACE_DUSTKTAIL">
		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The dusktails are a small tribe of squirrelfolk who dwell in the secluded settlement of Oakhollow Village to the east of the valley's center. They are serious, secretive, and therefore a subject of much curiosity and suspicion among other animalfolk. Dusktails practice arcane and dark magics misunderstood by outsiders, yet their people stand steadfastly by in defending their home from threats such as Calamity Beasts. Though their rituals are disturbing, they help keep the valley safe and in balance.</p>
			<h4>Mysterious and Misunderstood</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>The most mysterious and often gossiped about, misunderstood of all the animalfolk of Eldrimor are the Dusktails of Oakhollow Village. They are arcane magic users- a mixture of arcanists, ritualists, and warlocks specializing in darker magics not as usually seen around. Their practice might give off sinister feelings, for they deal with deceased animalfolk in rituals to attain their ends, but the Dusktails are staunchly on the side of good, using their powers to protect the valley.</p>
            <h4>Misinterpreted Motives</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Despite their grace demeanor and reluctance to explain their actions, the Dusktails are driven by a deep sense of duty. They have obtained permission from the leaders of Three Tree City to use corpses in rituals that are vital for energy transference, divination, and combating the Calamity Beasts. These dark rituals, while unsettling to many, are essential in the ongoing struggle against these menacing creatures.</p>
			<h4>Structured Society</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Within Oakhollow Village, the Dusktails live under a mild hierarchy. The Seedmeiser, their leader, assigns roles based on each Dusktail's strengths, ensuring the village thrives. Though their roles are structured, they are flexible and open to negotiation. Their mysterious practices may set them apart, but their contributions are invaluable to the safety and well-being of the valley.</p>
			<h4>DUSKTAIL TRAITS</h4>
			<br/>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Dusktails reach maturity by age 15 and can live up to 80 years.</p>

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses after a long rest.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Though tiny in stature, the Nibblewhisk, hamster-like beings are beyond question the defenders of the Shadowfen Woods. They live within the same boundaries as the Hoppwick and are known to be both brave and resilient, rising to take up their arms time and time again in defense of their homeland from terrifying Calamity Beasts that would seek to upset the peace. Their courage in the face of danger is unmatched, as they treat the protection of their valley like a duty given to them by a higher power.</p>
			<h4>Determined Heroes</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>The Nibblewhisk are close-knit, bound by shared purpose and unerring care for the valley and all within it. They get along well enough with other animal folk, especially if they contribute to the prosperity and safety of their home. When a Nibblewhisk sets their mind on a goal, very little can remove them from their path.</p>
            <h4>Peaceful Pursuits</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>The Nibblewhisk enjoy, during peaceful times, the simple things in life within Lupinflower Village. They take a great amount of pride in their positions within the community, be it tending gardens, crafting, or helping out their neighbors. They also love adventures, journeying out into the world outside the village and returning home with new stories and experiences to share.</p>
			<h4>A Life of Balance</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Though fierce in defense, the Nibblewhisk also love all those quiet moments of serenity and happiness their life in Lupinflower Village brings. They believe that there needs to be a balance between duties as protectors and the need to enjoy the fruits of their labor. This will maintain their strength and spirit in always being prepared to rise to the occasion whenever the valley is in need.</p>

	<element name="Rotkin" type="Race" source="Spencer's Homebrew" id="ID_RACE_ROTKIN">
		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The secretive race of ratfolk known as the Rotkin inhabit the Forest of the Chillhavens Breath. While their interests align with those of those other animalfolk in fighting against the Calamity Beasts, they do things in their own peculiar manner. Their seclusion and general reluctance to deal with outsiders often makes it difficult for allies, let alone enemies, to make contact with them when their services are needed.</p>
			<h4>Psychic Manipulators</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Subtle and cunning. Rotkin rely most heavily on their innate psychic powers. They use such powers in attempts to influence others so that the tides of events turn in their favor. They nonetheless maintain a firm alignment with good. Using their talents to bring the hidden truths to light, they navigate the complex Calamity movement.</p>
            <h4>Inquisitors and Rogues</h4>
			<p>There are primarily two roles amongst the Rotkin: Inquisitors, who use their psychic magic to wring out information, and Sneaks, who do it with stealth and cunning. From merely overhearing crucial conversations to reveal damning evidence, the Rotkin have become integral to the process for revealing the plans of those bent upon threatening their world.</p>
			<h4>Independent and Egalitarian</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Though Rotkin society is very egalitarian, meaning all of its members are considered to be equal regardless of role, from a skilled psychic to the stealthy rogue and to a caretaker whose role is to ensure the well-being of the community, every Rotkin is equally valued. But then, they do not really take pleasure in being too social, speaking to each other only if need be. That is independence and individual self-sufficiency for the people who can thrive in isolation in this village setting but keep watch for the ever-presence of the Calamity Beasts.</p>
			<h4>ROTKIN NAMES</h4>
			<br/>
			<p class="indent">Most names for Rotkin often reflect their cunning, resourcefulness, or scavenger-like tendencies.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="feature">Names:</span>Scrimjaw, Gnash, Viktik, Rattletooth, Squeal, Nekkrit, Scurr, Skitter, Flek, Snarl, Rizka, Nixx, Skria, Vikka, Rikkit, Chiz, Nyris, Krisska, Muzzi, Rattlewhisker.</p>
			<h4>ROTKIN TRAITS</h4>
			<br/>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity, Intelligence, and Constitution scores increase by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Rotkin mature quickly, reaching adulthood around 5 years old. They typically live up to 50 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most Rotkin are neutral, with some leaning toward good, always disliking evil in their unique ways.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Rotkin are considered small creatures, no more than 4 feet tall.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Information Gatherer.</em></strong> Choose one of the following skills: Insight or Stealth. You have proficiency in the chosen skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Unbreakable Will.</em></strong> You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Additionally, you have resistance to Psychic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mysterious Mind.</em></strong> Your thoughts cannot be read by any means unless you allow it. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mindwhisk.</em></strong>As a bonus action, you momentarily diminish your enemies' talents. Every creature within a 15-foot cone originating from you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier, your choice when you select this race). For the next minute, if a creature that failed the save would deal damage for the first time in a turn, that damage is reduced by your level + your Proficiency bonus (if multiple instances of damage are present, only one of them is reduced). You must concentrate on this effect as if concentrating on a spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses after a long rest. Whenever you succeed on an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws, you can regain one expended use of this feature.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.</p>

	<element name="Sanguin" type="Race" source="Spencer's Homebrew" id="ID_RACE_SANGUIN">
		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Born out of a sinister rite that blended celestial and ancient vampire energy with sorcerous magic, sanguins were designed to fit in with human society while carrying out the vampire creators' wishes. Many sanguins eventually broke away from their sinister beginnings in an effort to find a method to reconcile their vampire and human halves.</p>
			<h4>Twilight Born</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Sanguins, descendants of ancient bloodlines, possess a primarily human appearance that allows them to blend seamlessly into society. However, their eerie heritage manifests in subtle but distinct traits, such as unnaturally bright eyes that often shimmer in low light and sharp, slightly pointed teeth that evoke suspicions of vampiric ancestry. These physical markers, though rare and often overlooked, can occasionally stir fear or fascination in those who notice them. Despite these hints of their supernatural lineage, sanguins are adept at navigating human communities, using their resemblance to humanity to form lasting relationships and lead lives of duality. Some sanguins choose to embrace their hidden heritage, wielding the powers passed down from their ancestors in secret, while others suppress these gifts in an effort to assimilate completely. Their ability to move between worlds—one mundane, the other shadowed by their mysterious origins—makes them versatile and complex beings, often torn between the need for belonging and the call of something darker.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="feature">Names:</span>Nightborne, Veilblood, Shadowkin, Duskwraith, Noctisborn, Bloodveil, Lumenfang, Gloommarked, Shadeborn, Dreadkin, Twilightbound, Eclipsed, Umbravine, Silvershade, Fellborn.</p>
			<h4>SANGUIN TRAITS</h4>
			<br/>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Sanguins mature at the same rate as humans but can live up to 500 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Sanguins tend to fall within Neutral to Neutral Evil, though it can vary widely depending on the individual's background, upbringing, and personal choices.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Sanguins stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, generally weighing from 125 to 250 pounds. Your size is medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your part unholy and vampiric nature sets your base walking speed to 35 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Vampiric Resilience.</em></strong> You have resistance to necrotic damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sanguine Magic.</em></strong> You know the Drain Life cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Charm Person once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast Invisibility on yourself once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bloodthirst Quench.</em></strong> As an action, you can drink a bit of blood of a willing creature, or one that is incapacitated or dead within the last minute. Drinking blood this way deals 1 piercing damage to the creature. This effect provides you the benefits of a short rest. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Vampiric.</p>
