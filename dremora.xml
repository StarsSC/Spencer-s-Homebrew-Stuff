		<description>
			<p class="flavor">The Dremora are creatures of great strength and steadfast loyalty that live in the darkest recesses of the Abyss, which are home to the most evil beings. Standing between six and eight feet tall, these humanoids had skin as dark as the abyss itself, with hints of grey and scarlet.</p>
			<h4>Selfish and Ambitious</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Dremora are infamous for their complete lack of mercy, ambition, and haughtiness. They make deals with evil or chaotic neutral lesser deities, pledging conquest, increased rank, or any other favor deemed deserving in exchange for their fighting skills and dedication.</p>
      <h4>A Strict Hierarchy</h4>
      <br/>
      <p>Organized into clan-like structure, Dremora are categorized into distinct ranks, each holding varying degrees of power and prestige. From the lowly Churl to the esteemed Valkynaz, they navigate a hierarchical society fueled by rivalry and ambition. While it's common for groups or entire clans to forge pacts with deities, there are instances where individual Dremora pursue their own agendas, driven by personal ambition or a thirst for power.</p>

			<span class="feature">Names:</span>Voragorath, Drakulorin, Zalthorak, Morgrath, Nexilvar.</p>
			<h4>SANGUIN TRAITS</h4>
			<br/>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and Constitution increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Dremora mature at the same rate as humans, but live about twice as long on the material plane. On the plane of the Abyss, they can live practically forever, unless slain.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Dremora are typically evil, driven by pride, ambition, and mercilessness. Without pacts, they may very rarely lean towards neutrality, and when bound by agreements with lesser deities, they often become lawful.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Dremora typically stand between 6 to 8 feet tall. Your size is medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Infernal Boon.</em></strong> You know the Firebolt cantrip, Strength is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Abyssal Veil.</em></strong> You cannot be detected by spells or abilities that detect the presence of fiendish creatures, such as Divine Sense or Detect Evil and Good.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Gifts from Oblivion.</em></strong> Upon reaching 3rd level, after your first long rest, you are granted a weapon known as the "Sword of Inferno". This weapon can be either a Longsword or Greatsword, determined by your choice. The Sword of Inferno is considered magical and deals an additional 1d4 fire damage on hit.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dark Condemnation.</em></strong> If you die, your death is permanent and you cannot be resurrected by any means. Any attempt to cast resurrection spells or similar magic on you instantly transports your soul to the plane of the Abyss instead, where you shall remain for eternity.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Abyssal.</p>
