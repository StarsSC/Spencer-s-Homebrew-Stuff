  <element name="Cloak of Solitude" type="Magic Item" source="Spencer's Homebrew" id="ID_WOTC_DND_HOMEBREW_CLOAK_OF_SOLITUDE">
    <description>
      <p>The Cloak of Solitude was crafted centuries ago by the enigmatic sorceress Elandra, known for her deep wisdom and solitary nature. Elandra, seeking refuge from a world filled with treachery and deceit, imbued the cloak with powerful enchantments to protect herself from the myriad poisons of her enemies. The forcefield, a unique feature of the cloak, was added to ensure her peace and solitude, gently pushing away any who attempted to intrude upon her sanctuary. Legends say that Elandra wove her longing for solitude into every thread, creating an artifact that not only shields its wearer from harm but also grants them the tranquility she so desperately sought. The cloak has since passed through the hands of many, each owner finding in it a profound sense of protection and peace.</p>
