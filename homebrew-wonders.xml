    <p>The thrall of cosmic power, of infinite potential; who could resist? A golden crown roiling with interstellar energy. While attuned to this item you can speak, read, and write Celestial can use it as an arcane focus. This item has 4 charges and regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. Through time, accomplishment, and growth, this item can grow into its Awakened state, then into its Exalted state (according to your DM).
