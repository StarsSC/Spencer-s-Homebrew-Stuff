  <element name="The Faustian Burn" type="Magic Item" source="Spencer's Homebrew" id="ID_WOTC_DND_HOMEBREW_FAUSTIAN_BURN">
    <description>
	   <p>This replacement limb is forged of blackened steel fused with ember-veined flesh. Faint smoke curls from the knuckles, and the scent of scorched ash lingers wherever you go. It is said to be the result of a desperate bargain with an infernal patron, its power fueled by your soul's slow erosion.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>Infernal Strike.</strong> The Faustian Burn functions as a magical melee weapon for your unarmed strikes made with that arm dealing an additional 1d4 fire damage.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong>Ember Grasp (1/Short Rest).</strong> As a bonus action, you can cause the arm to flare with heat for 1 minute. While active:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your unarmed strikes with the arm deal an extra 1d6 fire damage.</li>
          <li>If you successfully grapple a creature with the arm, it takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns while grappled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="indent"><strong>Pact Scars.</strong> When you roll a natural 20 on an attack using the arm, you can choose to deal an additional 2d6 fire damage. If you do so, you take fire damage equal to half the total fire damage dealt.</p>

	   <p>With this chalk, you can use it to travel long distances on the Material plane and to other planes of existence.</p>
      <p class="indent">You draw a symbol on a door, that you associate with an individual or the plane of existence and knock three times on the door, someone on the other side must open the door or else the spell won't take effect.</p>
      <p class="indent">Anti magic warding spells and charms prevent the enchantment on the door from taking place, making the chalk fizzle and dissipate from the surface.</p>

    <description>
	   <p><strong>Planar Wayfinder.</strong> Before using this compass, you must choose a plane of existence and spend one minute to align the compass to that plane of existence. When the compass is aligned, it points to the nearest portal or rift that leads to that plane of existence.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can align the compass to the material plane and all elemental planes. You can also align the compass to any plane of existence you have been to before.</p>
      <p class="indent">You may attempt to align the compass to a plane of existence you have never been to by making an Arcana check. Your DM decides the DC for this check, The difficulty depends on your familiarity with the plane of existence and the nature or location of the plane itself. If the check is unsuccessful, the compass may not function at all, or it may become aligned to a different plane.</p>

  <element name="Bond of the Wildguard" type="Magic Item" source="Spencer's Homebrew" id="ID_WOTC_DND_HOMEBREW_BOND_OF_THE_WILDGUARD">
    <description>
	   <p><strong><em>May only be attuned by a Ranger...</em></strong></p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>The Bond of the Wildguard is a set of intertwined bracers and reins that seem to pulse with the heartbeat of nature itself. The bracers are crafted from living vines and reinforced with plates of smooth, polished stone, while the reins are made from braided strands of silver that shimmer in moonlight. When touched, the materials feel as though they are alive, responding subtly to the emotions and intent of the wearer.</strong></p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>Ancient lore states that this artifact was woven by the elemental spirits of the Wilds, at the behest of the first Beastmaster and Cavalier to unify their bond with their animal companions. Legends speak of its creation during an age when nature was under siege by those who sought to exploit its bounties without reverence. The Wildguard was given to champions who vowed to defend the balance of nature and protect its creatures.</strong></p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>When worn, the Bond strengthens the connection between the bearer and their beast companion, granting them an unparalleled synergy. The bond itself hums with a low, soothing resonance, as though it amplifies the unspoken communication between kindred spirits. Those attuned to it report feeling the raw essence of nature coursing through their veins, empowering them to fight not as individuals, but as a unified force with their beast allies.</strong></p>
      <p class="indent"><strong>The Bond of the Wildguard is also said to house the blessing of the Primal Guardians, ancient entities tied to the preservation of lifeâ€™s natural order. In moments of great peril, these guardians are rumored to manifest briefly to protect their chosen champions, their presence marked by the rustling of unseen leaves and the roar of distant storms.</strong></p>
      <p class="indent"><em>Beastmaster's Bond:</em> Your beast companion gains the following bonuses:
        <ul>
          <li>+4 AC, +30 temporary hit points, and advantage on attack rolls.</li>
          <li>Your companion can make an additional attack when you take the Attack action</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="indent"><em>Cavalier's Command:</em> While mounted, you gain the following benefits:
        <ul>
          <li>Enemies within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone other than you.</li>
          <li>Your mount gains advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would frighten or restrain it.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="indent"><em>Primal Rally:</em> As a bonus action, you and your companion can move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
      <p class="indent"><em>Alpha's Cry:</em> Once per long rest, you and your companion unleash a primal roar. All allies within 30 feet gain temporary hit points equal to your level and can immediately make one weapon attack as a reaction. Enemies within the same radius must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute</p>

	<element name="Chaosheart Amulet" type="Magic Item" source="Spencer's Homebrew" id="ID_WOTC_DND_HOMEBREW_CHAOSHEART_AMULET">
    <description>
      <p><strong><em>Must be attuned by a Warlock...</em></strong></p>
   	    <p class="indent"><strong>The Chaosheart Amulet is a mesmerizing, otherworldly artifact, its core resembling a living, unblinking eye set within a jagged crystal. The "eye" shifts colors constantly, cycling through hues of fiery orange, icy blue, venomous green, and more, as though it reflects the chaos of the multiverse itself. When attuned, the amulet pulses with faint warmth, synchronizing with its bearerâ€™s heartbeat. The chaotic energy radiating from the artifact hums with whispers, sometimes encouraging, sometimes maddening, but always compelling.</strong></p>
        <p class="indent"><strong>Legend speaks of the Chaosheart being crafted from the shattered essence of an ancient, primordial entity that existed before the alignment of the planes. It is said that the fragment was imbued with sentience by a powerful Chaos Patron who wished to give their warlocks a piece of themselves. Its eye-like design is no mere aesthetic; it is believed to be a window into the chaotic planes, eternally gazing upon the swirling forces of entropy.</strong></p>
        <p class="indent"><strong>While wearing the amulet, its bearer feels a deep connection to the unpredictable and unknowable. However, this connection comes with a price: moments of clarity are often interspersed with intrusive visions of cataclysmic destruction or wild euphoria. To many Chaos warlocks, the Chaosheart is a mark of favor, but to others, it is a burden of untamed power waiting to be unleashed.</strong></p>
      <p class="indent"><em>Chaotic Bolts:</em> Eldritch Blast now deals an additional 1d10 damage of a randomly determined type (roll 1d6: 1 = fire, 2 = cold, 3 = lightning, 4 = acid, 5 = necrotic, 6 = radiant).</p>
      <p class="indent"><em>Ripple of Chaos:</em> When you cast a spell using a spell slot, you can unleash a wave of chaotic energy. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 damage of a randomly determined type (roll 1d6 for the damage type). This ability can be used a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and all uses refresh after a long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><em>Wild Convergence:</em> When you use your Mystic Arcanum, roll 1d4. On a 4, you immediately regain that use after the spell is cast.</p>
      <p class="indent"><em>Chaos Nexus:</em> Once per long rest, you can cchannel the raw energy of chaos into an overwhelming surge of power. For the next 3 rounds:
        <ul>
          <li>When you roll damage for a spell, add an additional 3d6 damage of a randomly determined type (roll 1d6 for each spell).</li>
          <li>Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you succeeds on a saving throw against one of your spells, roll a d20. On a 15 or higher, the creature takes half the damage the spell would have dealt, regardless of the saving throw result</li>
          <li>Spells you cast during this time cannot be countered or dispelled.</li>

           <li><strong>Amplify:</strong> If the spell deals damage, reroll any roll of 1 or 2 on the damage dice, but you must use the new roll</li>
           <li><strong>Condense:</strong> If the spell deals damage in an area of effect such as a sphere, line, or cone, you can halve the area of effect (ex. 20 feet to 10 feet). Each creature in the spell's area of effect makes their saving throw with disadvantage.</li>
           <li><strong>Type:</strong> If the spell deals one of the following damage types, you can replace it with another one of the following types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison. If the spell has multiple damage types, you can change only one of them.</li>
           <li><strong>Lengthen:</strong> If the spell has a range of at least 5 feet and doesn't have a range of Self, you can increase the range of the spell by 30 times your Intelligence modifier.</li>
           <li><strong>Timing:</strong> You can change the casting time of a spell from 1 action to 1 bonus action, or vice-versa.</li>

             When you use the Rewrite property you can choose to alter the affected spell in one additional way without spending an additional charge. When a creature within 120 feet of you casts a spell, you are aware of it and know the direction of the caster as you can sense all the magic around you.</p>

             Your mastery of the arcane arts has advanced to such a degree that all magic is at your beck and call. You can use your reaction to use the Rewrite property to alter spells cast by other creatures within 120 feet of you. An unwilling creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by your Intelligence (Arcana) check.</p>
             <p class="indent">The rewrite property gains the following ways to alter a spell:</p>

               <strong>
                 <em>Redirect:</em>

    <description>
      <p>The Cloak of Solitude was crafted centuries ago by the enigmatic sorceress Elandra, known for her deep wisdom and solitary nature. Elandra, seeking refuge from a world filled with treachery and deceit, imbued the cloak with powerful enchantments to protect herself from the myriad poisons of her enemies. The forcefield, a unique feature of the cloak, was added to ensure her peace and solitude, gently pushing away any who attempted to intrude upon her sanctuary. Legends say that Elandra wove her longing for solitude into every thread, creating an artifact that not only shields its wearer from harm but also grants them the tranquility she so desperately sought. The cloak has since passed through the hands of many, each owner finding in it a profound sense of protection and peace.</p>
