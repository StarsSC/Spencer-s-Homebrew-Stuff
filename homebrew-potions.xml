    <p>The taste of this potion is quite bitter and some may argue that the pickled catchy culm foaling in there seems a bit repulsive. Its effect, however, is said to be moving - in the most literal sense.</p>
    <p class="indent">When you drink this potion, the peculiar magic of the catchy culm flows through your body. Whenever you deal damage to a creature within 10 feet of you or you take damage from a creature within the same range, you can initiate a Charisma contest against that creature. If you win the contest, you teleport the creature to an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of it. Otherwise, the creature teleports you to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of you. The potion's effect lasts for 1 minute.</p>
