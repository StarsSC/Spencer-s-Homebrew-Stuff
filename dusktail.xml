			<p>The dusktails are a small tribe of squirrelfolk who dwell in the secluded settlement of Oakhollow Village to the east of the valley's center. They are serious, secretive, and therefore a subject of much curiosity and suspicion among other animal folk. Dusktails practice arcane and dark magics misunderstood by outsiders, yet their people stand steadfastly by in defending their home from threats such as Calamity Beasts. Through their rituals are disturbing, they help keep the valley safe and in balance.</p>

			<p>As a bonus action, you can choose a creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you. You can apply one of the following effects to that creature: <ul>
      <li>Immediately end the Frightened condition on that creature.</li>
      <li>Force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you gain all expended uses after you finish a long rest.</p>
