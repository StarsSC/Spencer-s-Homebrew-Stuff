		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Though tiny in stature, the Nibblewhisk, hamster-like beings are beyond question the defenders of the Shadowfen Woods. They live within the same boundaries as the Hoppwick and are known to be both brave and resilient, rising to take up their arms time and time again in defense of their homeland from terrifying Calamity Beasts that would seek to upset the peace. Their courage in the face of danger is unmatched, as they treat the protection of their valley like a duty given to them by a higher power.</p>
			<h4>Determined Heroes</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>The Nibblewhisk are close-knit, bound by shared purpose and unerring care for the valley and all within it. They get along well enough with other animal folk, especially if they contribute to the prosperity and safety of their home. When a Nibblewhisk sets their mind on a goal, very little can remove them from their path.</p>
            <h4>Peaceful Pursuits</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>The Nibblewhisk enjoy, during peaceful times, the simple things in life within Lupinflower Village. They take a great amount of pride in their positions within the community, be it tending gardens, crafting, or helping out their neighbors. They also love adventures, journeying out into the world outside the village and returning home with new stories and experiences to share.</p>
			<h4>A Life of Balance</h4>
			<br/>
			<p>Though fierce in defense, the Nibblewhisk also love all those quiet moments of serenity and happiness their life in Lupinflower Village brings. They believe that there needs to be a balance between duties as protectors and the need to enjoy the fruits of their labor. This will maintain their strength and spirit in always being prepared to rise to the occasion whenever the valley is in need.</p>
