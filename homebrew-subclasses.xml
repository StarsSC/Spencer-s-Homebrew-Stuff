        <p><em>Once the Shield of Ironspire, Now a Warrior without a Banner...</em></p>
        <p class="indent">The Exiled Crest were once the elite warriors of Ironspire, sworn protectors of the city's rulers and enforcers of its will. Betrayed, cast out, or forsaken, these warriors now walk their own path, honing their skills beyond the rigid traditions they once upheld. No longer bound by duty, they have become weapons of their own making- unpredictable, adaptable, and unrelenting.</p>

        <p>The fall from grace has only hardened your resolve. You have learned to fight without the support of a legion, adapting to any battlefield. Choose one of the following battlestances at the start of your turn (no action required):</p>
        <p class="indent"><em><strong>Sentinel's Aegis:</strong></em> When a creature within 5 feet of you attacks an ally, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack. You also gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
        <p class="indent"><em><strong>Vengeful Strike:</strong></em> The first time you take damage each round, you gain advantage on your next weapon attack and deal extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
        <p class="indent"><em><strong>Ghost Step:</strong></em> Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you can take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action. Opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.</p>
      <p>You can switch between these stances at the start of your turn.</p>

        <p>You refuse to kneel, no matter how dire the situation. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + half the damage taken). On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this feature once per long rest. Additionally, you gain proficiency in Strength saving throws if you don't already have it.</p>
