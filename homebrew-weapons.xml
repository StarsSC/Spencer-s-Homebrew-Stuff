      <p>You gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls you make while holding this weapon and only spellcasters may attune. A sickly butcher's blade of cold black iron. It seethes with eldritch magicks emitting from harshly carved hex runes. While holding this weapon you can use it as an arcane focus. This weapon has 3 charges. Once per day in place of an attack you can carve at your flesh to have this item regain a charge, taking 1d10 slashing damage in the process. Alternatively, as a 1-hour ritual you can infuse the blade with sinister energies to have it regain a charge. This ritual requires at least a pound of natural animal or plant matter, regaining a charge for each pound of material which is consumed by the ritual.

    <description>
	    <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. The gifted horns of woodland creatures were ritually fused to create this massive blade. While attuned, you are considered proficient with it and you may add your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength modifier to damage and attack rolls with it. This weapon has a number of charges equal to twice your proficiency bonus and regains all charges at dawn.</p>

          <strong>
            <em>Evolutionary Gifts.</em>
          </strong>
          While attuned to this weapon you grow a pair of large horns from your head. These horns remain when you Wild Shape and change in size to match any form. Your horns are a natural weapon that count as simple melee weapons with which you are proficient. You add either your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with these horns. On a hit this weapon deals 1d8 piercing damage and you can spend a charge to deal an amount of additional radiant damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
        </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Gouging Branch.</em>
        </strong>
        When you hit a creature with this weapon or your horns you can spend a charge to have the ends of the blade or horns pierce a creatures body. The target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 2d6 piercing damage and becomes grappled by the weapon. On a successful save the target only takes half as much damage and is not grappled. If the grappled creature breaks the grapple it takes an additional 1d6 piercing damage as the horns tear at its body. You cannot attack any creatures with the weapon other than the grappled creature as long as they remain grappled this way. You can choose to end the grapple as a bonus action, causing the horns to shrink back to their original size.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Fury of the Forest</em>
        </strong>
        As an action you can spend up to 3 charges to plunge this weapon into the ground and cause a forest of horns to burst from the earth. Each other creature within a 30-foot radius of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 piercing damage per charge on a failed save. On a successful save the target only takes half as much damage.

    <description>
	    <p>This magical obsidian dagger has three white crystals embedded in its hilt and a blade that never needs sharpening. It seems to exude an aura of malice.
        <ul>
          <li>When you hit with a melee attack using Soulshard you deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</li>
          <li>If you reduce the target to 0 hit points, the dagger absorbs the soul of the target, causing instant death. Throughout the duration of the next short or long rest you take, one of the white crystals turns blood red and the dagger becomes a +1 weapon and deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. Each time you reduce a target to 0 hit points, another crystal turns red over the duration of the next short or long rest, the dagger becomes a +2 and +3 weapon for each target killed (max of 3), and each increase deals another 1d6 necrotic damage.</li>
          <li>However, for every 1d4 days that this dagger is not used to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, one of the crystals turns back to white and the dagger reverts to its less powerful form.</li>
        </ul>

    <description>
	    <p>This dagger has a sharp metal blade, similar to normal daggers of its kind, but the hilt is made of leather in the shape of a human hand. Wielding this blade would make it seem as though it were a handshake. Once initiative has been rolled but before combat starts, you may choose one of these effects that will last until the end of the initiative.
    	<ul>
        <li>The blade is engulfed in a hellish flame, gain 1d8 fire damage on all damage rolls.</li>
        <li>The blade extends and is either transformed into a scimitar or a shortsword, changing the damage roll to be 1d6 Slashing.</li>
        <li>Roars of thunder echo off the blade, gain 1d8 thunder damage on all damage rolls.</li>
        <li>The River Styx coat this weapon in a unfathomable frost, deal 1d8 cold damage on all damage rolls.</li>
        <li>Light cannot determine where this weapon is at all times, whenever this weapon is thrown, it is immediately returned to the wielder.</li>
        <li>At the cost of part of your own life (1d6 hit points of your maximum is reduced) to cast the Blight spell. May increase spell level up to 9th but must increase d6 per spell level increase.</li>
        <li>Whatever obstacle troubles you, it shall know your wrath, give yourself over to me, and triumph you shall find.</li>
