    <description>
     <p>Modeled after birds of prey, this sword was made to pierce through armor, rewarding vicious wielders. It deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage and has 3 charges, recovering 1d3 of them every day at dusk.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Talon.</em>
        </strong>
        Enchanted with a taste for death, this sword seeks enemies. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Beak.</em>
        </strong>
        When you make an attack with Carrion Eater against a creature wearing armor, you can choose to deal no damage on a hit to pierce through said armor. On a hit, roll 1d8 and reduce their AC by 1 on rolls of 1 to 5 and by 2 on rolls of 6 to 8. If this would reduce their AC without counting any ability modifier bonuses below 10, it stops at 10.
        <p class="indent">If you roll a critical hit on a creature with armor, you both deal damage and reduce their AC as written above.</p>
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Appetite.</em>
        </strong>
        Carrion Eater is sustained by death and shares its meals with you. Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with an attack made with it, you can expend a number of charges to recover 1d6 hit points per charge expended.

    <description>
     <p>Gifted by the Murder, this dagger's pommel is decorated by a different trinket whenever it's unsheathed - shiny rocks, pieces of metal or colored glass shards are the most common finds. It has 3 charges that are regained every day at dusk.</p>

          <em>Birds of a Feather.</em>

        When you make an attack with Murder of Crows, you can summon a spectral copy of it on your other hand. This copy disappears at the start of your next turn (or before it, if you wish to).
        <p class="indent">Additionally, you can expend 1 charge when you make a ranged attack with the original to summon it back to your hand.</p>

          <em>Sharp Beak and Claws.</em>

        When you make an attack with Murder of Crows, you can spend a number of charges so the Murder aids you. You deal an extra 1d6 slashing damage per charge on a hit and you score a critical hit on a number lower than 20 per charge expended - from 17 to 20 with 3 charges, for example.
        <p class="indent">However, your critical failure chance is raised in the same way - from 1 to 4 with 3 charges, for example - and you suffer 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier slashing damage on such a failure.</p>

	    <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. The gifted horns of woodland creatures were ritually fused to create this massive blade. While attuned, you are considered proficient with it and you may add your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength modifier to damage and attack rolls with it. This weapon has a number of charges equal to twice your proficiency bonus and regains all charges at dawn.</p>

          <strong>
            <em>Evolutionary Gifts.</em>
          </strong>
          While attuned to this weapon you grow a pair of large horns from your head. These horns remain when you Wild Shape and change in size to match any form. Your horns are a natural weapon that count as simple melee weapons with which you are proficient. You add either your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with these horns. On a hit this weapon deals 1d8 piercing damage and you can spend a charge to deal an amount of additional radiant damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

        <strong>
          <em>Gouging Branch.</em>
        </strong>
        When you hit a creature with this weapon or your horns you can spend a charge to have the ends of the blade or horns pierce a creatures body. The target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 2d6 piercing damage and becomes grappled by the weapon. On a successful save the target only takes half as much damage and is not grappled. If the grappled creature breaks the grapple it takes an additional 1d6 piercing damage as the horns tear at its body. You cannot attack any creatures with the weapon other than the grappled creature as long as they remain grappled this way. You can choose to end the grapple as a bonus action, causing the horns to shrink back to their original size.

        <strong>
          <em>Fury of the Forest</em>
        </strong>
        As an action you can spend up to 3 charges to plunge this weapon into the ground and cause a forest of horns to burst from the earth. Each other creature within a 30-foot radius of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 piercing damage per charge on a failed save. On a successful save the target only takes half as much damage.

	    <p>This magical obsidian dagger has three white crystals embedded in its hilt and a blade that never needs sharpening. It seems to exude an aura of malice.
        <ul>
          <li>When you hit with a melee attack using Soulshard you deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</li>
          <li>If you reduce the target to 0 hit points, the dagger absorbs the soul of the target, causing instant death. Throughout the duration of the next short or long rest you take, one of the white crystals turns blood red and the dagger becomes a +1 weapon and deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. Each time you reduce a target to 0 hit points, another crystal turns red over the duration of the next short or long rest, the dagger becomes a +2 and +3 weapon for each target killed (max of 3), and each increase deals another 1d6 necrotic damage.</li>
          <li>However, for every 1d4 days that this dagger is not used to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, one of the crystals turns back to white and the dagger reverts to its less powerful form.</li>
