          <li>If you reduce the target to 0 hit points, the dagger absorbs the soul of the target, causing instant death. Throughout the duration of the next short or long rest you take, one of the white crystals turns blood red and the dagger becomes a +1 weapon and deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. Each time you reduce a target to 0 hit points, another crystal turns red over the duration of the next short or long rest, the dagger becomes a +2 and +3 weapon for each target killed (max of 3), and each increase deals another 1d6 necrotic damage.</li>
