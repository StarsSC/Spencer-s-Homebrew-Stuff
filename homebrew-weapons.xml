    <description>
      <p>Forged from a mysterious substance known as Oozeron, the blade of Essence Tether embodies the resilience of the oozes it represents. This material renders the greatsword impervious to all forms of conventional damage, ensuring its longevity on the battlefield...</p>
      <p class="indent">
        Essence Tether is considered magical and its blade cannot be destroyed by any means short of a <em>Wish</em> spell, <em>Divine Intervention</em>, or chaotic extraplanar effectts.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        Once per short rest, the wielder can evoke the latent power within the Essence Tether to bind the essence of a struck creature to the blade momentarily. Upon hitting the creature with an attack using this greatsword, the wielder can choose to activate this ability. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's essence becomes tethered to the sword, granting the wielder a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls against the tethered creature for 1 minute.</p>

          <em>Crystalline Petrification.</em>
        </strong>
        With a focused strike, the wielder can imbue the Quartz Cleaver with the power to petrify their foes. When the wielder hits a creature with an attack using the Quartz Cleaver, they can choose to activate this ability. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 14) or begin to petrify, becoming restrained as their body turns to crystal. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If a creature fails the saving throw three times in a row, they become fully petrified, as per the Flesh to Stone spell, until they receive a Greater Restoration or similar magic. This ability can only affect creatures of Large size or smaller and can be used once per short rest.</p>

    <p>The Seaslicer is a stunning weapon that resembles a beautiful seahorse. Its hilt is made of a durable material that resembles the body of a seahorse, which the blades, one at the rear of the seahorse's head a smaller one at its chest, shimmer in a light grey tint, much like the gleaming scales of a real seahorse. When the axe is activated, the seahorse's eyes, which are normally calm and misty, burst into a dark orange flame, producing an eerie aura around it. The lower section of the axe is meticulously wrapped in bandages, providing both a pleasant grip and a touch of mystery about its origins.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The wielder gains a swim speed equal to their walking speed and can breathe underwater as easily as they breathe air.</li>
          <li>When the wielder hits a creature with the Seaslicer, the target takes an additional 1d6 force damage. Additionally, they can choose to unleash a burst of booming energy. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + their proficiency bonus) or be pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone if they are Huge or smaller.</li>
          <li>The wielder gains resistance to force and fire damage</li>

	    <p>The Blade of Cosbony is a masterfully crafted shortsword, forged by the legendary blacksmith and enchanter, Billsby Cosbony. Renowned for his unparalleled skill and innovative enchantments, Cosbony created this blade with a singular purpose: to incapacitate foes with a single, precise strike. This elegant shortsword is forged from a rare, silvery metal that gleams with a faint, otherworldly light. The blade is perfectly balanced, with a keen edge that promises both precision and lethality. Its hilt is wrapped in supple, dark leather, providing a secure grip, while the guard is adorned with intricate, swirling patterns that seem to dance and shift when viewed in the light. When a foe is hit with this weapon, the chance to score a critical hit is reduced by one (ex. 19-20 for Critical) and when you score a critical hit, the target is paralyzed for its next turn.</p>

Each other creature within a 30-foot radius of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 piercing damage per charge on a failed save. On a successful save the target only takes half as much damage.

    <description>
	    <p>This magical obsidian dagger has three white crystals embedded in its hilt and a blade that never needs sharpening. It seems to exude an aura of malice.
        <ul>
          <li>When you hit with a melee attack using Soulshard you deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</li>
          <li>If you reduce the target to 0 hit points, the dagger absorbs the soul of the target, causing instant death. Throughout the duration of the next short or long rest you take, one of the white crystals turns blood red and the dagger becomes a +1 weapon and deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. Each time you reduce a target to 0 hit points, another crystal turns red over the duration of the next short or long rest, the dagger becomes a +2 and +3 weapon for each target killed (max of 3), and each increase deals another 1d6 necrotic damage.</li>
          <li>However, for every 1d4 days that this dagger is not used to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, one of the crystals turns back to white and the dagger reverts to its less powerful form.</li>
        </ul>

	    <p>This dagger has a sharp metal blade, similar to normal daggers of its kind, but the hilt is made of leather in the shape of a human hand. Wielding this blade would make it seem as though it were a handshake. Once initiative has been rolled but before combat starts, you may choose one of these effects that will last until the end of the initiative.
    	<ul>
        <li>The blade is engulfed in a hellish flame, gain 1d8 fire damage on all damage rolls.</li>
        <li>The blade extends and is either transformed into a scimitar or a shortsword, changing the damage roll to be 1d6 Slashing.</li>
        <li>Roars of thunder echo off the blade, gain 1d8 thunder damage on all damage rolls.</li>
        <li>The River Styx coat this weapon in a unfathomable frost, deal 1d8 cold damage on all damage rolls.</li>
        <li>Light cannot determine where this weapon is at all times, whenever this weapon is thrown, it is immediately returned to the wielder.</li>
        <li>At the cost of part of your own life (1d6 hit points of your maximum is reduced) to cast the Blight spell. May increase spell level up to 9th but must increase d6 per spell level increase.</li>
        <li>Whatever obstacle troubles you, it shall know your wrath, give yourself over to me, and triumph you shall find.</li>
