        <p>One fateful day, you were dragged to one of the nine layers of the hells to fend for yourself, by means of a futile attempt to live on your own, being forced into servitude by the Infernal, or other means. By some miracle, you endured and survived in your time there and managed to escape, returning to a more pleasant realm and living to tell the tale of the harshness and despair that transpired.</p>
